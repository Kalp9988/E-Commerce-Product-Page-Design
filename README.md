##In Task 3, I designed an innovative e-commerce product page for a smart sneaker product. The layout included essential sections such as a high-resolution 360° product view, product specifications, pricing, available sizes, and an "Add to Cart" feature. I also designed a customer review section with user images, star ratings, and comments. Interactive components were added using Figma’s prototyping tools to simulate actions like image rotation and review scrolling. This task helped me better understand e-commerce UX principles, such as clarity, conversion-focused design, and mobile responsiveness.
